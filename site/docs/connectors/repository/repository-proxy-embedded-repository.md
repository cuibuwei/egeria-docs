#  A Repository proxy with an embedded native repository 

!!! info "Connector details"
- Connector Category:  [Repository and Event Mapper Connectors](/connectors/#repository-and-event-mapper-connectors)
- Hosting Service: [Local OMRS Repository Connector](/services/omrs/component-descrtiptions/local-repository-connector.md))
- Hosting Server: [repository proxy](/concepts/repository-proxy)
- Source Module: [Repository proxy with an embedded native repository :material-github:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-connector-omrs-caching){ target=gh }
- Jar File Name: `egeria-connector-omrs-caching-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

This is a [repository proxy](/concepts/repository-proxy) that caches content into a native repository.
It simplifies the development of a repository proxy repository because:

- All the OMRS APIs are delegated down to the embedded native repository, so there is no need to write any special technology 
- the event mapper can poll the 3rd party technology and add in the content to the embedded repository.

This connector maybe useful in the following cases:

- a quick way to show Egeria connectivity with a repository proxy connector
- it is a way to migrate 3rd party content into an Egeria native repository
- for small deployments, it provides a cache so queries can be honoured. 

In most cases an integration or standard repository proxy pattern is likely to be more appropriate. 

__Important notice__

The gradle JAR step will include some of the dependencies into the connector JAR, making is a semi-Fat Jar. This makes sure that additional dependencies are automatically deployed together with the connector.



## Configuration 
Each [type of OMAG Server](/concepts/omag-server/#types-of-omag-server) is configured by creating
a [configuration document](/concepts/configuration-document).

## Configure the connectors to the third party metadata repository

The mapping between a third party metadata repository and the open metadata protocols in a [repository proxy](/concepts/repository-proxy) is implemented by two connectors:

- A [repository connector](/concepts/repository-connector)
- A [event mapper connector](/concepts/event-mapper-connector)

They are configured as follows.

### Configure the repository connector

The repository proxy can act as a proxy to a third party metadata repository. This is done by adding the connection for the [repository connector](/concepts/repository-connector) as follows.


!!! post "POST - configure as a repository proxy"
```
{{baseURL}}/open-metadata/admin-services/users/{{user}}/servers/{{server}}/local-repository/mode/repository-proxy/connection
```

The request body is a [virtual connection](/concepts/connection/?h=embeddedconnection#virtual-connections), which contains an EmbeddedConnection, which should refer
to the required native repository connector that will act as the cache.
In the below example the cache uses the [XTDB connector](/connectors/repository/xtdb/).
