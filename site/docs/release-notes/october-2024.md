# October 2024

Welcome to the Egeria community's October 2024 newsletter.  Since our [last newsletter](/release-notes/june-2024), the community has been focused on adding support for Unity Catalog and improving the user experience in the *egeria workspaces*.


## Full release notes for V5.1

The full release notes for version 5.1 can be found on [Egeria's website](https://egeria-project.org/release-notes/previous/#release-51-october-2024).

## Future plans

Release 5.2 will continue to build out new [view services](/services/omvs) supported by `pyegeria`, and connectors, such as survey action services, to increase its out-of-the-box connectivity.

There is also work on a new text-based UI for supporting data professionals in their work.

## Connecting with the project

With our new focus on Python and supporting data practitioners directly, the community is looking for new contributors to the project.  If these topics interest you, then please contact us and we can help you get started.
