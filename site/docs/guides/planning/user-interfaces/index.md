# User Interfaces

Most users will work with Egeria's open metadata through their existing tools.  These tools are integrated into the Open Metadata Ecosystem so that Egeria can add, update and delete appropriate content in these tools.  Integrating tools into the open metadata ecosystem is described in the [Integration Guide](/guides/integration).

There are, however, some specialist user interfaces provided to support functions that are unique to Egeria.

* Egeria's [General User Interface](/user-interfaces/general/overview) makes use of Egeria's federated view of your organization's metadata to provide an enterprise asset catalog search and lineage viewer.  This UI will aggregate search results from across the open metadata ecosystem.  The aim is to show a complete, up-to-date picture.  It may not operate as fast as a dedicated asset catalog that has been integrated into the open metadata ecosystem and is maintaining open metadata from Egeria in a local repository. 
* Egeria's [Python widgets](/user-interfaces/python-widgets/overview) provide text-based displays of Egeria's runtime status, and displays of related metadata elements.  They are aimed at a technical user who is working directly with Egeria and wishes to verify that something is either set up correctly or operating as expected.
* Egeria's [Explorers](/user-interfaces/brain-explorers/overview) provide a cloud-based graphical interface for exploring Egeria's [Open Metadata Type System](/types) and its [Content Packs](/content-packs).
