# User Interfaces

Most users will work with Egeria's open metadata through their existing tools.  These tools are integrated into the Open Metadata Ecosystem so that Egeria can add, update and delete appropriate content in these tools.  Integrating tools into the open metadata ecosystem is described in the [Integration Guide](/guides/integration).

There are, however, some specialist user interfaces provided to support functions that are unique to Egeria.

* Egeria's [Python widgets](/user-interfaces/python-widgets/overview) provide text-based displays of Egeria's runtime status, and displays of related metadata elements.  They are aimed at a technical user who is working directly with Egeria and wishes to verify that something is either set up correctly or operating as expected.
* Egeria's [Explorers](/user-interfaces/brain-explorers/overview) provide a cloud-based graphical interface for exploring Egeria's [Open Metadata Type System](/types) and its [Content Packs](/content-packs).
