# Automated Curation Open Metadata View Service (OMVS)

The Automated Curation OMVS provides services that can be used to set up and monitor the automation services from Egeria:

* Retrieving information about [deployed_implementation types](/concepts/deployed-implementation-type) with their linked templates and resources.
* Adding catalog targets to [integration connectors](/concepts/integration-connector) runnning in an [Integration Daemon](/concepts/integration-daemon).
* Initiating governance action types, governance action processes and [engine actions](/concepts/engine-action).
* Monitor the outcomes of engine actions.

It uses the [Asset Owner OMAS](/services/omas/asset-owner/overview) for its metadata services.
