# Open Metadata View Services (OMVS)

The Open Metadata View Services (OMVS) provide task oriented, domain-specific services for user interfaces to integrate with open metadata.  They provide REST APIs.

The view services are as follows:

| [Collection Manager](/services/omvs/collection-manager/overview)      | **Manage collections of assets and other elements.**                                                          | The Collection Manager OMVS provides the REST APIs to create collections of asset and other elements such as glossary terms or policies.  The collections can be nested (like folders in a file system) and they can be classified to describe the type of collection.  For example, one type of classification for a collection is a *DigitalProduct* that allows the collections of assets and other related material to describe data and or services for a specific consumer or purpose.                                  |

## Inside an OMVS

The OMVS APIs are deployed together in a [View Server](/concepts/view-server). User Interfaces connect to an OMVS through its REST API. The REST API interacts with a remote [Metadata Access Server](/concepts/metadata-access-server) to retrieve and maintain metadata.

## Configuring an OMVS

The [administration services](/services/admin-services/overview) provide the ability to [configure a View Server](/guides/admin/servers/by-server-type/configuring-a-view-server).
