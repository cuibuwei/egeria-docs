# Open Metadata View Services (OMVS)

The Open Metadata View Services (OMVS) provide task oriented, domain-specific services for user interfaces to integrate with open metadata.  They provide REST APIs.

The view services are as follows:

It enables the retrieval of type data (relating to entities, relationships and classifications) and exploration of the graphs of entity type inheritance and the supported combinations of entity and relationship types.                                                                                      |
| [Dynamic Infrastructure and Operations](/services/omvs/dino/overview) | **Admin interface to inspect servers, services, cohorts and platforms.**                                      | The Dino OMVS is for user interfaces that support Egeria operators who need to inspect, navigate or explore the open metadata servers, services, cohorts and platforms that are configured or actively running. It is intended for operations and problem-determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Server Author](/services/omvs/server-author/overview)                | **An authoring interface for servers.**                                                                       | The Server Author OMVS is for user interfaces that support Egeria Server authors. This user interface allows the author to create, delete or update a server configuration using an intuitive UI, rather than needing to use the low level admin rest calls and associated json payloads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 



## Inside an OMVS

The OMVS APIs are deployed together in a [View Server](/concepts/view-server). User Interfaces connect to an OMVS through its REST API. The REST API interacts with a remote [Metadata Access Server](/concepts/metadata-access-server) to retrieve and maintain metadata.

## Configuring an OMVS

The [administration services](/services/admin-services/overview) provide the ability to [configure a View Server](/guides/admin/servers/by-server-type/configuring-a-view-server).
