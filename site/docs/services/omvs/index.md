# Open Metadata View Services (OMVS)

The Open Metadata View Services (OMVS) provide task oriented, domain-specific services for user interfaces to integrate with open metadata.  They provide REST APIs.

The view services are as follows:

| OMVS                                                                  | Summary                                                                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

This means that as terms and categories are created, updated and deleted, these changes are invisible to the general user until they are approved.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Repository Explorer](/services/omvs/rex/overview)                    | **Explorer interface to inspect instances across a cohort of repositories.**                                  | The Repository Explorer (Rex) OMVS is for user interfaces that support enterprise architects who need to inspect, navigate or explore the instance data stored in an open metadata repository or a cohort of repositories. It enables the retrieval of instance data (entities and relationships) and exploration of the graph of instances connected to those entities. This enables the user to construct a graph (as a diagram) to visualize the details and connectivity of a group of instances of interest to the user. |
| [Type Explorer](/services/omvs/tex/overview)                          | **Explorer interface to inspect types across a cohort of repositories.**                                      | The Type Explorer (Tex) OMVS is for user interfaces that support enterprise architects who need to inspect, navigate or explore the open metadata types supported by a repository or a cohort of repositories. It enables the retrieval of type data (relating to entities, relationships and classifications) and exploration of the graphs of entity type inheritance and the supported combinations of entity and relationship types.                                                                                      |

It is intended for operations and problem-determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Server Author](/services/omvs/server-author/overview)                | **An authoring interface for servers.**                                                                       | The Server Author OMVS is for user interfaces that support Egeria Server authors. This user interface allows the author to create, delete or update a server configuration using an intuitive UI, rather than needing to use the low level admin rest calls and associated json payloads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 



## Inside an OMVS

The OMVS APIs are deployed together in a [View Server](/concepts/view-server). User Interfaces connect to an OMVS through its REST API. The REST API interacts with a remote [Metadata Access Server](/concepts/metadata-access-server) to retrieve and maintain metadata.

## Configuring an OMVS

The [administration services](/services/admin-services/overview) provide the ability to [configure, start and stop a View Server](/guides/admin/servers/configuring-a-view-server).
