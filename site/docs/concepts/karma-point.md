# Karma Point

A karma point is a reward given to an actor profile for making a contribution to open metadata.
This may be for:

* Creating some information
* Correcting or enhancing some information
* Linking information together
* Removing obsolete information

Karma points are awarded automatically.  They are stored in an actors's [actor profile](/concepts/personal-profile).
When an actor's karma point total reaches a multiple of the karma point notification threshold,
the Community Profile OMAS sends a notification on its [OutTopic](/concepts/out-topic).
