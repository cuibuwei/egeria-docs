# Governance Action Process Step

A *governance action process step* is a step in a [governance action process](/concepts/governance-action-process). The *governance action process steps* are linked together form a graph that shows the flow of actions that should be performed when a [governance action process](/concepts/governance-action-process) runs.

Governance action process steps are defined and linked into a governance action process flow through the [Open Governance Service](/services/gaf-metadata-management).  Behind the scenes, this flow is stored using metadata elements described in [0462 Governance Action Processes](/types/4/0462-Governance-Action-Processes).
