# Governance Action

A *governance action* describes an automated service that governs either metadata, or the digital resource it describes.  A governance action is described either as a [governance action type](/concepts/governance-action-type) or a [governance action process](/concepts/governance-action-process).  It can be run by calling the [open governance service](/gaf-metadata-management) included in any [Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS)](/services/omas) or through the [Automated Curation OMVS](/services/omvs/automated-curation/overview).

!!! tip "*Governance Action* was renamed to *Engine Action* in release 5.0"
    If you have been using Egeria for a while, you may be familiar with the term *Governance Action* as the mechanism used to control the execution of automated actions in the Engine Hosts.  In [release 5.0](/release-notes/5-0), *Governance Action* was renamed to [*Engine Action*](/concepts/engine-action) to create a greater name differentiation between the concepts that are used to define the governance behaviour and those used to control the execution of this behaviour.  The term *Governance Action* is now used as a general term for a [Governance Action Process](/concepts/governance-action-process) or a [Governance Action Type](/concepts/governance-action-type).
