# Governance Action Type

A *Governance Action Type* is a template that describes a call to a [governance engine](/concepts/governance-engine).  Through the [open governance service](/services/gaf-metadata-management), it is possible to use the governance action type to initiate the specified call to the governance engine.  The result is the creation of an [engine action](/concepts/engine-action) that controls the execution of the call.
