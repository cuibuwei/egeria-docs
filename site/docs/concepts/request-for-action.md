# Request for Action

A Request For Action (RfA) identifies an issue detected by a [Survey Action Service](/concepts/survey-action-service) while it is running. For example, the Survey Action Service may perform a test on some data (such as a quality rule) or discovers an anomaly in the data landscape compared to its metadata.

The requested action may be an automated [governance action](/concepts/governance-action) or, more typically, requires a steward to resolve.  It is not the responsibility of the Survey Action Service to find the means to resolve the issue - it is only responsible for reporting it.
