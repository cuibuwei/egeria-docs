# Governance Engine Definition

A *governance engine definition* describes the [governance services](/concepts/governance-service) that can be invoked in a [governance engine](/concepts/governance-engine).  It consists of a list of [governance request types](/concepts/governance-request-type) that define the logical names of each of the functions of the governance engine.  Each governance request type is mapped to one [governance service](/concepts/governance-service) implementation along with request parameters to configure the behaviour of the service in a [governance engine definition](/concepts/governance-engine). A governance service may support many request types, and execute different behaviors based on the request parameters and its configuration properties.

There are three types of governance engine and they each support a specialist type of governance service.  Therefore, the governance engine definitions include definitions of governance services that are consistent with the type of governance engine.

| Type of Governance Engine                                              | Type of Governance Service                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Governance action engine](/concepts/governance-action-engine)         | [Governance action service](/guides/developer/governance-action-services/overview)         | Monitor and manage the content of open metadata across the open metadata landscape.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [Survey action engine](/concepts/survey-action-engine)                 | [Survey action service](/guides/developer/survey-action-services/overview)                 | Analyze the content of [digital resources](/concepts/digital-resource) in the digital landscape and create annotations that are attached to the resource's [asset](/concepts/asset) metadata element in the open metadata repositories in the form of a [survey report](/concepts/survey-report). |
| [Repository governance engine](/concepts/repository-governance-engine) | [Repository governance service](/guides/developer/repository-governance-services/overview) | Provide additional management of the open metadata repositories that are members of the connected [cohorts](/concepts/cohort-members).                                                                                                                                                            |

Each governance engine definition describes a single engine and its specialized services as illustrated below.

!!! education "Further information"

    * Governance engine definitions are typically defined in a [governance engine pack](/guides/developer/open-metadata-archives/creating-governance-engine-packs) or through the [Governance Server OMAS](/services/omas/governance-server/overview) API.
    
    * The Open Metadata Types model [0461 Governance Engines](/types/4/0461-Governance-Engines) shows the types for a governance engine definition.
    
    * Governance engines are run by the [Open Metadata Engine Services (OMES)](/services/omes) in an [Engine Host](/concepts/engine-host) OMAG Server.  The [Engine Host Services](/services/engine-host-services) called the [Governance Server OMAS](/services/omas/governance-server/overview)
