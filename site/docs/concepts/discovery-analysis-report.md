# Discovery Analysis Report

A *discovery analysis report* contains one or more sets of related properties that an [open discovery service](/concepts/open-discovery-service) has discovered about the resource, its metadata, structure and/or content. These are stored in a set of [discovery annotations](#discovery-annotations) linked off of the discovery analysis report.

It is attached to the [asset](/concepts/asset) for the [digital resource](/concepts/digital-resource) that was analysed.  Overtime, the discovery analysis reports show how the digital resource's contents are changing.

The discovery analysis report is created in the open metadata repository by the [Asset Analysis OMES](/services/omes/asset-analysis/overview) when it creates an new open discovery service instance. The open discovery service can retrieve information about the discovery analysis report through the [discovery analysis report store](/guides/developer/open-discovery-services/overview/#discovery-analysis-report-store) client. This client is accessed through the [discovery annotation store](/guides/developer/open-discovery-services/overview/#discovery-annotation-store).

The discovery analysis report store also enables a long-running discovery service (typically an [open discovery pipeline](/concepts/open-discovery-service/#open-discovery-pipeline) to record its current analysis step.
