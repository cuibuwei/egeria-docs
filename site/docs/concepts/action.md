# Action

An *action* is a metadata entity that describes an activity required by the governance defined for the open metadata ecosystem.  There are two types of action:

* A [To Do](/concepts/to-do) is an action that must be performed by a third party, typically a person.
* An [Engine Action](/concepts/engine-action) is an automated action that is performed by a [governance engine](/concepts/governance-engine).
