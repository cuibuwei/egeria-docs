# Learning about Egeria

--8<-- "snippets/getting-started.md"

Egeria is a big project tackling a complex problem.  There is a lot to learn. The choices below give you the opportunity to target your learning to both your immediate and long term needs. 

## Hands on Labs

The [Hands on Open Metadata Labs](/education/open-metadata-labs/overview) provide an interactive environment that allows you to experiment with different capabilities of Egeria.  They are organized by role so you can select the roles of interest to you.

## Individual tutorials

The individual tutorials focus on a specific tool, or group of related tasks.  They allow you to pick the education needed for a specific task.

- [Running Egeria's Samples](/education/tutorials/running-samples-tutorial)
- [Testing Egeria](/education/tutorials/testing-egeria-tutorial)

## Technology comparisons

Sometimes it is useful to learn about a new technology by understanding how it compares to one you are familiar with.  The technology comparisons can be used to map Egeria's functions to the functions of another technology that you might be familiar with.
