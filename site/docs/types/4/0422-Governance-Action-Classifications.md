* *Criticality* describes how critical a resource is to the operations of the organization.
* *Confidentiality* typically is used with a data resource and indicates how confidential its content is.
* *Confidence* indicates how confident the organization in the use of this resource in terms of its quality.
* *Retention* defines how long a resource (typically a data resource) needs to be kept.
