# 0690 Request for Action

A RequestForAction entity (RfA) is used to trigger the [Stewardship Action OMAS](/services/omas/stewardship-action/overview).

It is used when a [survey action service](/concepts/survey-action-service) performs a test on the data (such as a quality rule) or has discovered an anomaly in  the data landscape compared to its metadata that potentially needs a steward or a curator's action.
