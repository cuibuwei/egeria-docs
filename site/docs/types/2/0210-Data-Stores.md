# 0210 Data Stores

Both [*DataSets*](/types/0/0010-Base-Model#dataset) and [*DataStores*](#datastore) are types of [*Asset*](/types/0/0010-Base-Model#dataset) that represent a collection of data.  The *DataStore* is a physical store, whereas the *DataSet* is dynamically constructed on request.  This model introduces the *DataStore* and the relationship that shows how *DataSets* are constructed from them.

![UML](0210-Data-Stores.svg)

## DataStore entity

The *DataStore* entity describes a physical [digital resource](/concepts/resource) that supplies data.  The *deployedImplementationType* attribute describes the class of technology that is used in its implementation.  Values for the *deployedImplementationType* attribute can be managed for consistency in a [*deployed implementation type*](/concepts/deployed-implementation-type) valid value set.

## DataContentForDataSet relationship

The *DataContentForDataSet* relationship defines how data is supplied to a [DataSet](/types/0/0010-Base-Model) from a particular [digital resources](/concepts/resource).  The DataSet entity includes a property called *formula*.  This describes the logic that is used to populate the data set.  The formula can include placeholders.  These placeholders are defined by the *queryId* properties in the linked DataContentForDataSet relationships.  The associated *query* property describes how the data from the linked dataContent resource is selected.

## DataStoreEncoding classification

The *DataStoreEncoding* classification provides the ability to store details of the data stores physical characteristics.

## DataScope classification

The *DataScope* classification identifies the scope of the data stored in the [resource(s)](/concepts/resource) represented by the entity it is attached to.  This classification can be attached to any [*Referenceable*](/types/0/0010-Base-Model), but it is typically associated with assets such as *DataStores* and *DataSets*.  The attributes of this classification identify the scope of the data in space and time.

* *minLongitude* - if the data is bound by an area, this is the longitude for bottom-left corner of the bounding box (BBOX) for the area covered by the data.
* *minLatitude* - if the data is bound by an area, this is the latitude for the bottom-left corner of the bounding box (BBOX) for the area covered by the data.
* *maxLongitude* - if the data is bound by an area, this is the longitude for top-right corner of the bounding box (BBOX) for the area covered by the data.
* *maxLatitude* - if the data is bound by an area, this is the latitude for top-right corner of the bounding box (BBOX) for the area covered by the data.
* *minHeight* - if the height above ground is relevant, this is the lowest height that the data covers.
* *maxHeight* - if the height above ground is relevant, this is the highest height that the data covers.
* *startTime* - if the data is bound by time, this is the start time.
* *endTime* - if the data is bound by time, this is the end time.
