# Open Metadata Types Content Pack

The *OpenMetadataTypes* contains all of the [open metadata type definitions](/types)  provided by Egeria. It is supplied for external utilities since each [OMAG server](/concepts/omag-server) capable of being a [cohort member](/concepts/cohort-member) will load these types on start up.
