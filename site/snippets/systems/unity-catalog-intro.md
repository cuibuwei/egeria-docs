[Unity Catalog](https://www.unitycatalog.io/) is a data manager catalog that governs access to data.  It is typically managing data from data lakes and lakehouses where much of the data is in a parquet format, with a table abstraction over the top.  Unity catalog also supports folders of files (called Volumes) and functions.  Unity catalog is able to provide access to the data in its catalogs, and run the functions.
