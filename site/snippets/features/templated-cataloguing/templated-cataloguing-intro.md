When a new [resource](/concepts/resource) is catalogued, the [asset](/concepts/asset) catalog entry of a similar resource can be used as a template to set up the asset for the new resource. The copying process extends to every entity, and its linking relationships that are [anchored](/concepts/anchor) to the asset template, plus relationships to other entities outside of the anchoring scope. This means that the new asset can contain governance metadata attachments, not just the technical metadata extracted from the digital resource.

Templated cataloguing can be used for any type of element, not just assets.  It has the advantages that:

* The resulting catalogued elements are much more consistent with one another making it easier for people to understand and work with.
* The increased consistency simplifies automation.
* Much of the complexity involved in creating a new catalog entry is hidden from the cataloguing user.
* Required classifications and governance relationships can be guaranteed to be included in each catalog entry.
