There are ten types of governance services.  Related governance services are [packaged together in a specific type of governance engine](/concepts/governance-engine-definition) and enabled in one or more [Engine Host OMAG Servers](/concepts/engine-host).  They run in the appropriate [Open Metadata Engine Service (OMES)](/services/omes) as shown in the table below.

| Governance Service                                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Governance Engine type                                                 | Engine Service                                                              |

| [Survey Action Service](/guides/developer/survey-action-services/overview)                 | Analyses the content of an [Asset's](/concepts/asset) real-world counterpart ([digital resource](/concepts/digital-resource)) in the digital landscape. (For example, if the asset describes a file, the survey action service analyses the data stored in the file). Results of the analysis are stored in a [Survey Report](/concepts/survey-report)                                        | [Survey Action Engine](/concepts/survey-action-engine)                 | [Survey Action OMES](/services/omes/survey-action/overview)                 |
| [Watchdog Governance Service](/guides/developer/governance-action-services/overview)       | Monitors changes to open metadata elements and when certain changes occur (such as the creation of a new [Asset](/concepts/asset)) the watchdog service requests action from other governance services by creating either an [Engine Action](/concepts/engine-action), a [Governance Action Process](/concepts/governance-action-process) or an [Incident Report](/concepts/incident-report). | [Governance Action Engine](/concepts/governance-action-engine)         | [Governance Action OMES](/services/omes/governance-action/overview)         |
| [Verification Governance Service](/guides/developer/governance-action-services/overview)   | Tests the properties of specific open metadata elements to ensure they are set up correctly or do not indicate a situation where governance activity is required.  The [results](/concepts/guard) returned from the verification service can be used to trigger other governance services as part of a [Governance Action Process](/concepts/governance-action-process).                      | [Governance Action Engine](/concepts/governance-action-engine)         | [Governance Action OMES](/services/omes/governance-action/overview)         |
| [Triage Governance Service](/guides/developer/governance-action-services/overview)         | Makes decisions on how to handle a specific situation or incident.  Often this involves a human decision maker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [Governance Action Engine](/concepts/governance-action-engine)         | [Governance Action OMES](/services/omes/governance-action/overview)         |
| [Remediation Governance Service](/guides/developer/governance-action-services/overview)    | Corrects errors in open metadata or the digital landscape it represents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Governance Action Engine](/concepts/governance-action-engine)         | [Governance Action OMES](/services/omes/governance-action/overview)         |
| [Provisioning Governance Service](/guides/developer/governance-action-services/overview)   | Configuring, enabling, provisioning resources in the digital landscape.  Often these provisioning services manage the cataloguing of new assets and the lineage between them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [Governance Action Engine](/concepts/governance-action-engine)         | [Governance Action OMES](/services/omes/governance-action/overview)         |
