??? warning "Known Issues"

    ??? info "Use chromium-based browser for UIs"
         It is recommended to use a chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Apple Safari for the Egeria Ecosystem UI. Some parts of the UI experience such as Dino currently experience problems with Firefox. See [odpi/egeria-react-ui#96 :material-dock-window:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/96){ target=gh }.

???+ functional "Functional changes"

    ???+ "Historical Query"
      The [Egeria Ecosystem UI](/user-interfaces/ecosystem) has a new 'historical query' capability. You can now issue queries in the past and 
      if the repository supports it you can work with Rex at a time in the past. See the [Repsotory Explorer user guide](/guides/ecosystem-ui/rex-user-guide) for how to use
      the repository explorer. 
  
      Historical query is available in release [3.8.1](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/releases/tag/V3.8.1). 3.8 has a bug such that the Repository Explorer Explore button errors
      in many scenarios.
