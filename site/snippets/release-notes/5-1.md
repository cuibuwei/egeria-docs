## Release 5.1 (Expected August 2024)

_**These are DRAFT release notes.  The notes will be updated until & when 5.1 is released**_

??? functional "Open Metadata Types"
    * The [ConnectorType](/types/2/0201-Connectors-and-Connections) entity type has a new attribute called *supportedDeployedImplementationType* which replaces *deployedImplementationType to separate the technology it supports from other uses of *deployedImplementationType* that identify its implementation technology.
    * The [CatalogTarget](/types/4/0464-Dynamic-Integration-Groups) relationship is now multi-link which means it is possible to have multiple instances of this relationship between the same two entities.  It also has two new attributes: *permittedSynchronization* and *deleteMethod*.
    * The [DataAssetEncoding](/types/2/0210-Data-Stores) classification, that attaches to a [DataAsset](/types/0/0010-Base-Model), replaces the [DataStoreEncoding](/types/2/0210-Data-Stores) classification.  The *DataStoreEncoding* is deprecated.
    * There is a new type of entity called [VirtualRelationalTable](/types/2/0235-Information-View) for representing virtualized tables.
    * There are two new relationships relating to [governance actions](/concepts/governance-action).  [TargetForActionType](/types/4/0462-Governance-Action-Processes) and [TargetForActionProcess](/types/4/0462-Governance-Action-Processes) allow targets for action to be pre-defined for a governance action type or governance action process respectively.  The [GovernanceActionProcessFlow](/types/4/0462-Governance-Action-Processes) relationship receives a new property called `requestParameters`.  Finally, there is a new entity type called [GovernanceActionProcessInstance](/types/4/0462-Governance-Action-Processes) that represents a running instance of a Governance Action Process.  It captures the start and end time of the process's execution.

??? functional "Unity Catalog Support"
    * There are new [survey services and integration connectors](/connectors/unity-catalog) to support the new open-source Unity Catalog (UC).

??? functional "Smarter integration daemon"
    * In addition to the regular refreshes, the integration daemon will refresh an integration connector whenever a new catalog target is attached.
