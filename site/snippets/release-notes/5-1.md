??? functional "Open Metadata Types"
    * The [ConnectorType](/types/2/0201-Connectors-and-Connections) entity type has a new attribute called *supportedDeployedImplementationType* which replaces *deployedImplementationType to separate the technology it supports from other uses of *deployedImplementationType* that identify its implementation technology.
