## Release 5.1 (Expected July 2024)

_**These are DRAFT release notes.  The notes will be updated until & when 5.1 is released**_

??? functional "Open Metadata Types"
    * The [ConnectorType](/types/2/0201-Connectors-and-Connections) entity type has a new attribute called *supportedDeployedImplementationType* which replaces *deployedImplementationType to separate the technology it supports from other uses of *deployedImplementationType* that identify its implementation technology.
    * The [CatalogTarget](/types/4/0464-Dynamic-Integration-Groups) relationship is now multi-link which means it is possible to have multiple instances of this relationship between the same two entities.

??? functional "Unity Catalog Support"
