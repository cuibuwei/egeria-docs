??? warning "Known Issues"

    This section highlights any significant issues to be aware of. Refer to our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/issues) for a full list of open issues or to open a new one.

    ??? info "Use chromium-based or Safari browser for UIs"
         It is recommended to use a chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Apple Safari for the Egeria Ecosystem UI. Some parts of the UI experience such as Dino currently experience problems with Firefox. See [odpi/egeria-react-ui#96 :material-dock-window:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/96){ target=gh }.

    ??? info "Ecosystem UI minor issues"

        We are continuing to develop the Ecosystem UI & improve it's capability and usability. These are not regressions in this release. Known issues include:

        * [odpi/egeria-react-ui#461](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/463){ target=gh } - Dino: cannot retrieve server audit log twice.
        * [odpi/egeria-react-ui#465](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/463){ target=gh } - Dino: Error retrieving cohort information in Dino.
        * [odpi/egeria-react-ui#464](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/464){ target=gh } - Buttons can appear off screen. Workaround is to enlarge window.
        * [odpi/egeria-react-ui#465](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/465){ target=gh } - Search dialog still appears if no server selected.

        See [odpi/egeria-react-ui](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues){ target=gh } for all issues or to open a new one on this UI.

    ??? info "Documentation Link errors"

        We are aware of broken links in the documentation here, as well as broken links to the documentation contained within the Egeria code -
        for example links to component information.

        We are trying to fix these as we update the docs, but please raise any additional problems found in [egeria-docs](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-docs/issues){ target=gh }.
        We would also be very grateful for any PRs that fix issues.

??? functional "Open Metadata Types"

    * The *ProcessingState* classification for *SoftwareCapabilities** has been added to model [0042 Software Capabilities](/types/0/0042-Software-Capabilities).
    * The *RootSchemaType* entity has been added to model [0530 Tabular Schemas](/types/5/0530-Tabular-Schemas).  This acts as a common super type for *SchemaTypes* that represent the root element of a schema that attaches to an Asset, Port etc.  The following subtypes of *SchemaType* now inherit from *RootSchemaType*: [TabularSchemaType](/types/5/0530-Tabular-Schemas), [DocumentSchemaType](/types/5/0531-Document-Schemas), [ObjectSchemaType](/types/5/0532-Object-Schemas), [RelationalDBSchemaType](/types/5/0534-Relational-Schemas), [EventType](/types/5/0535-Event-Schemas), [APISchemaType](/types/5/0536-API-Schemas), [DisplayDataSchemaType](/types/5/0537-Display-Schemas), and [QuerySchemaType](/types/5/0537-Display-Schemas).

??? functional "Helm Chart versions"

    These charts may get updated more frequently than Egeria code releases, as we integrate other components and fix bugs. You can always check the latest with `helm repo update && helm search repo egeria `

    Note that the Business UI remains at an older version, as the code is currently undergoing some refactoring.

    To see known issues/upcoming work or to report issues see [egeria-charts](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-charts/issues){ target=gh }

??? functional "Improved metadata security performance"

    Egeria's [server metadata security connector](/concepts/server-metadata-security-connector) includes an optional interface that allows specific authorization checking for requests that involve an asset.  The connector has its own bean to describe the asset that can be built from the asset's entity and its classifications.  In this release, the building of this asset bean has been moved from the [generic handlers]()
