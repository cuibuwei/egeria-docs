## Release 3.10 (July 2022)

??? warning "Known Issues"

    This section highlights any significant issues to be aware of. Refer to our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/issues) for a full list of open issues or to open a new one.

    ??? info "Use chromium-based or Safari browser for UIs"
         It is recommended to use a chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Apple Safari for the Egeria Ecosystem UI. Some parts of the UI experience such as Dino currently experience problems with Firefox. See [odpi/egeria-react-ui#96 :material-dock-window:](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/96){ target=gh }.

    ??? info "inmemory repository intermittent/timing issue"

        We have noticed a few issues with the in-memory repository during testing which are still being investigated:

        * [odpi/egeria#6549](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/issues/6549){ target=gh }
        * [odpi/egeria/#6552](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/issues/6552){ target=gh }

        Both have only been in specific testcases and are intermittent, most likely timing related.

        These issues have not been seen with the local graph repository.

        If you do see any problems in this area, please comment on the issue or get in touch via our usual channels.


    ??? info "Ecosystem UI minor issues"

        We are continuing to develop the Ecosystem UI & improve it's capability and usability. These are not regressions in this release. Known issues include:

        * [odpi/egeria-react-ui#461](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/463){ target=gh } - Dino: cannot retrieve server audit log twice.
        * [odpi/egeria-react-ui#465](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/463){ target=gh } - Dino: Error retrieving cohort information in Dino.
        * [odpi/egeria-react-ui#464](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/464){ target=gh } - Buttons can appear off screen. Workaround is to enlarge window.
        * [odpi/egeria-react-ui#465](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues/465){ target=gh } - Search dialog still appears if no server selected.

        See [odpi/egeria-react-ui](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-react-ui/issues){ target=gh } for all issues or to open a new one on this UI.

    ??? info "Business UI lab - asset not found"

        The 'Egeria UI' lab notebook (ui-labs/ui-asset-search.ipynb) explains how to search for an asset in the UI. This does not work for the asset listed.
        See [odpi/egeria#6547](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/issues/6547){ target=gh } for more information.

    ??? info "Documentation Link errors"

        We are aware of broken links in the documentation here, as well as broken links to the documentation contained within the egeria code -
        for example links to component information.

        We are trying to fix these as we update the docs, but please raise any additional problems found in [egeria-docs](https://github.com/odpi/egeria-docs/issues){ target=gh }.
        We would also be very grateful for any PRs that fix issues.
    

??? functional "Functional changes"


    ??? info "cohort initialization edge case fixed"

        [odpi/egeria#6549](https://github.com/odpi/egeria/issues/6549){ target=gh } has now been fixed.

        This addresses a timing window during cohort initialization which primarily affected our conformance tests & labs. Cohort initialization events were missed by a new cohort joiner due to the delay (5-20 seconds) between a topic listener being started, and the initial offset being determined by kafka in the case where a new consumer was started (ie new server configured). This is now fixed. 

    See full changelog for details (below)


??? functional "Helm Charts"

    These charts may get updated more frequently than Egeria code releases, as we integrate other components and fix bugs. You can always check the latest with `helm repo update && helm search repo egeria `

    Note that the Business UI remains at an older version, as the code is currently undergoing some refactoring.
